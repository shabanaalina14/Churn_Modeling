# Churn_Modeling

Churn modeling is a predictive analytics technique used to identify customers who are likely to stop using a product or service. By understanding churn patterns, businesses can take proactive measures to retain customers and improve satisfaction.

- Data Collection: Gather historical data on customer behavior, demographics, and interactions.

- Feature Engineering: Create relevant features that may influence churn, such as usage frequency, purchase history, and customer service interactions.

- Model Training: Use machine learning algorithms (e.g., logistic regression, decision trees, neural networks) to build predictive models based on historical data.

- Evaluation: Assess model performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and AUC-ROC.

- Intervention: Implement targeted strategies to retain at-risk customers identified by the model, such as personalized offers or improved customer support.

Churn modeling helps businesses reduce customer attrition and increase long-term customer loyalty.
